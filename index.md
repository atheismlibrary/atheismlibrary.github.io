## Welcome to Atheism Library

Through this project, we aim to compile all conflicting, hypocritical and unethical texts from all the major religious sources, that can be fact checked directly from original source.

This project will try to help the people realize the true reality of their religious literature. At the end, we do not want to *hurt your sentiments* and just quoting texts as it is as they are present without any distortion.

## Religions 

Below is the list of currently compiled texts orgasined by reliogion and sub organised in books.

1. [Hinduism](hinduism/index.md)
2. [Islam](islam/index.md)
3. [Christianity](christianity/index.md)

## Contributions

Being completely new project, we have very low number of contributors. If you can contribute in any format, please reach out to us on atheismlibrary@gmail.com.
